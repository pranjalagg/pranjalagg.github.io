Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder majoring in Computer Science.
As a research student, I am broadly interested in all aspects of machine learning and big data. Specifically, my interest leans towards Natural Language Processing and the integration of structured knowledge and statistical models. Currently, I am actively seeking `summer '24 internship opportunities`.

Before my current studies, I earned my bachelors degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Dharwad where I was advised by [Dr. Pavan Kumar C](https://iiitdwd.irins.org/profile/102752). Under the guidance of [Dr. Shivakumara Palaiahnakote](https://www.salford.ac.uk/our-staff/shivakumara-palaiahnakote) and Dr. Pavan, I completed my senior year research titled "Tldsmi: Genetic Algorithm Based Network for Text Localization in Distorted Social Media Images" which is available as a preprint at the Social Science Research Network.

Outside of academia, I enjoy staying active with sports and exploring new destinations through travel.
