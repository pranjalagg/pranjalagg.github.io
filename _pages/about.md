Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by [Dr. Theodora Chaspari](https://chaspari.engr.tamu.edu/), majoring in Computer Science.
As a research student, I am broadly interested in all aspects of machine learning and big data. Specifically, my interest leans towards Natural Language Processing and the integration of structured knowledge with statistical models. Lately, I've been intrigued by large language models (LLMs), and I'm currently working on investigating their explainability and reasoning abilities. I'll be graduating in May 2025 and am actively looking for full-time opportunities in the field of machine learning.

Before my graduate studies, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Dharwad where I was advised by [Dr. Pavan Kumar C](https://vidwan.inflibnet.ac.in/profile/102752). Under the guidance of [Dr. Shivakumara Palaiahnakote](https://www.salford.ac.uk/our-staff/shivakumara-palaiahnakote) and Dr. Pavan, I completed my senior year research titled "A New Genetic Algorithm-Based Network for Text Localization in Degraded Social Media Images" which was published in IET Image Processing.

Outside of academia, I enjoy staying active with sports and exploring new destinations through travel.
