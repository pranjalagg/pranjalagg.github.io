Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder majoring in Computer Science.
As a research student, I am broadly interested in all aspects of machine learning and big data. Specifically, my interest lean towards Natural Language Processing and the integration of structured knowledge and statistical models. I am also looking for summer '24 internships.

Previously, I did my bachelors in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Information (IIIT) Dharwad where I was advised by [Dr. Pavan Kumar C](https://iiitdwd.irins.org/profile/102752). Under the guidance of [Dr. Shivakumara Palaiahnakote](https://www.salford.ac.uk/our-staff/shivakumara-palaiahnakote) and Dr. Pavan, I completed my senior year research titled "Tldsmi: Genetic Algorithm Based Network for Text Localization in Distorted Social Media Images" which is available as a preprint at the `Social Science Research Network`.

In my spare time I enjoy doing sports, travelling.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
